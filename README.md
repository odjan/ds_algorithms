# Data Structures and Algorithms

Objectives:
Code a working set of data structures and algorithms from scratch

Data Structures:
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stacks
- Queues (  pushed value --> head --> node -> node -> node (oldest)
- Hashing for Hash Table/Dictionary
- Binary Trees and Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Heaps
- Graphs  
- Vectors (important)

Algorithms:
- Dynamic Programming (key)
- Recursion
- Sorting (merge sort)
- DFS (key) vs BFS for trees and graphs
- and many more...!
